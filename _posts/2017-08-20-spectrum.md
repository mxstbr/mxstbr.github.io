Almost exactly 5 months ago I quietly started working on a new project. This time, not an open source or side project but a product. A company. Together with [Bryn](https://twitter.com/uberbryn) and [Brian](https://twitter.com/brian_lovin) we've created [Spectrum.chat](https://spectrum.chat), a platform tailor-made for large, online communities.

Being employed to work on OSS was an amazing experience and I'm ever grateful to [Jed](https://twitter.com/JedWatson), [Boris](https://twitter.com/BorisBozic) and the whole Thinkmill crew for the opportunity to do so for a year. I learned a lot and had a bunch of good times but it's exciting to be building something for actual _users_ again!

## Soooo, what exactly is Spectrum?

Today, lots of big online communities hack around existing chat platforms to make them work for their use case. Take for example Reactiflux: it's a (now) 20,000+ people strong community which started off on Slack, a business communication tool. Slack kicked them out when they got too big and now they're on Discord, a gaming chat service.

The issue is that fundamentally all of these chat services have the wrong model of communication. Even segregated into channels you quickly get 1,000 people in one chat feed at the same time which just plain doesn't work.

There's 15 conversations ongoing at the same time which nobody can follow. You wake up in the morning and want to talk about this one topic somebody mentioned 5 hours ago but the message is now 15 pages up and nobody knows what you mean anymore. Searching and linking to old messages is even more of a pain.

Fundamentally, pure chat as popularized by IRC doesn't scale.

### Spectrum

Bryn and Brian realised this because they run the SpecFM podcast network. They created a Slack team for it, but it had 9,000 members and Slack approached them and told them to get off of their platform. This led to a first very MVP version of Spectrum to see if they could build a platform for their own community around their own ideas.

Quickly realising that they're not the only ones with this problem I came on board and we started building Spectrum for real. We think, breathe and talk about the way we want our big communities to work, so Spectrum has some interesting properties that make it different from other platforms:

- Every conversation is threaded and has it's own place which you can link to, for example this [discussion about what makes a component](https://spectrum.chat/thread/d350b632-a12b-4490-97f8-603384142e01).
- At the same time messages are still real time, so it still feels like a conversation and not just like a comment thread.
- By having multiple (maybe sometime all?) of your communities in one place we can provide users with a single feed of all the things that are ongoing across all their communities.

## It exists!

We've been building Spectrum for the past five months, first as a public alpha for friends and family and then as a public beta with SpecFM as our big test bed. It's been five exciting months and I'm very proud of how far we've come if this short amount of time.

Already, there's vibrant and active communities around a wide variety topics like [React](https://spectrum.chat/react) (1,100+ people), [styled-components](https://spectrum.chat/styled-components) (700+ people), [Figma](https://spectrum.chat/figma), [crypto currencies](https://spectrum.chat/crypto) and [many more](https://spectrum.chat/explore)!

## We're hiring

There's so much more we want to do and **we're looking for some help** to do so! If you're a fullstack JavaScript developer with deep Node.js knowledge or an experienced React Native developer who isn't afraid to touch some backend code please contact us at [hey@spectrum.chat](mailto:hey@spectrum.chat).

We're fully remote so it doesn't matter where in the world you are. (Bryn and Brian are in San Francisco, I'm in Vienna, Austria) Our stack is a Node.js GraphQL server backed by RethinkDB and a React plus Apollo Client frontend. (knowledge of GraphQL is a plus, but not required) We're looking for folks that are happy to jump into all parts of the stack (no matter what your speciality is or if you have one) with an affinity for the early stages. There is a lot left to be figured out, so if you're not passionate about this space we might not be the perfect fit right now.
