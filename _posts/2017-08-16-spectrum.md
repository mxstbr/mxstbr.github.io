5 months ago I quietly started working on a new project. Not an open source or side project, a product. A company. Together with [Brian](https://twitter.com/brian_lovin) and [Bryn](https://twitter.com/uberbryn) **we've created [Spectrum.chat](https://spectrum.chat), a platform tailor-made for large, online communities**.

Being employed to work on OSS was an amazing experience and I'm ever grateful to [Jed](https://twitter.com/JedWatson), [Boris](https://twitter.com/BorisBozic) and the whole Thinkmill crew for the opportunity to do so for a year. I learned a lot and had a bunch of fun, but it's exciting to be building something for actual users!

## Soooo, what exactly is Spectrum?

We run some big, online communities on our own and are members of a bunch of others. Nowadays, almost all of them use chat platforms, often hacking around to make them work for their particular folks. (Slack, Discord, Gitter, to name a few)

As we spent more and more time in them we realised that these platforms aren't quite up to the task. Even segregated into channels, once you get a couple dozen people in one chat at the same time it starts breaking down.

<!-- Today, lots of big communities hack around existing chat platforms to make them work. The problems we've faced in our own communities and seen in others we're a part of shows that these platforms aren't quite up to the task. Even segregated into channels, once you get a couple dozen people in one chat at the same time it starts breaking down. -->

There are five conversations ongoing at the same time and you're not quite sure who's talking with whom so it's hard to follow and to jump between discussions. You want to talk about this one topic somebody mentioned five hours ago but the message is now 15 pages up and nobody knows what you're talking about anymore. This is amplified by the fact that searching and linking to old messages is often a pain. Don't even get me started on topics from days or even, gasp, topics from _weeks_ ago!

### The Spark

Brian and Bryn run a podcast network called [SpecFM](https://spec.fm). They created an "open" Slack team (as open as Slack teams can be) for all their listeners to join, but as it grew to 9,000 members it turned out Slack isn't the right place for it.

After investigating the different platforms that are used by others nothing quite fit the bill. So they set out to build a space specifically for the SpecFM community. Spectrum was born.

### The Flame

As they built a first MVP and talked about it with others they realised they're not the only ones that have a need for something like Spectrum. That's when they approached me about coming on board and turning this into a platform for all communities rather than just for theirs.

Based on our own experiences and of the tons of folks we've talked to about this (thank you!), Spectrum has some interesting properties that make it different from other platforms:

- Every conversation is threaded and has it's own place which you can link to, for example this [discussion about what makes a component](https://spectrum.chat/thread/d350b632-a12b-4490-97f8-603384142e01).
- At the same time, conversations still happen in real time, it still feels like a conversation and not a comment thread.
- Conversations are less time bound. Since everything is threaded, previous conversations routinely get contributed to again and a new spark is created about an old topic.
- By having your communities in one place (rather than separate pages) you get a single feed of all the things that are ongoing across all your communities.

## It exists!

We've been building Spectrum for the past five months, first as a public alpha for friends and family and then as a public beta with SpecFM as our test bed. It's been five exciting months and I'm very proud of how far we've come if this short amount of time.

Already, there's vibrant and active communities around a variety of (currently mostly tech-y) topics like [React](https://spectrum.chat/react) (1,100+ people), [styled-components](https://spectrum.chat/styled-components) (700+ people), [Figma](https://spectrum.chat/figma), [crypto currencies](https://spectrum.chat/crypto) and [many more](https://spectrum.chat/explore)!

Check out the [explore page](https://spectrum.chat/explore), find some topics that interest you and come chat; if the community you're looking for doesn't exist [create a new one](https://spectrum.chat/new/community), we'd love to have you!

## We're hiring

**NOTE(@mxstbr): This part isn't hashed out at all, we gotta make sure we're aligned on our priorities and who we want to hire. Ignore for now, treat as placeholder content!**

There's so much more we want to do and we're looking for some help! If you're **a fullstack JavaScript developer with deep Node.js knowledge** or **an experienced React Native developer** who isn't afraid to touch some backend code please contact us at [hey@spectrum.chat](mailto:hey@spectrum.chat).

We're looking for folks that are happy to jump into all parts of the stack with an bias towards shipping. We're fully remote so it doesn't matter where in the world you are. (Bryn and Brian are in San Francisco, I'm in Vienna, Austria) Our stack is a Node.js GraphQL server backed by RethinkDB and a React plus Apollo Client frontend. (knowledge of GraphQL is a plus, but not required)

The only real requirement is that you're passionate about what we're doing, as there is a lot left to be figured out and to be experimented with.
