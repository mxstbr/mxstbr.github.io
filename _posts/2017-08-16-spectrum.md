Five months ago I quietly started working on a new project: not an open source or side project, but a product and a company. It‚Äôs called [Spectrum](https://spectrum.chat){:target="_blank"}.

## Soooo, what exactly is Spectrum?

Spectrum is a new platform for you to join, start and build online communities. We‚Äôve designed it with scalability in mind, creating tools that make growing and managing communities faster and easier for groups and businesses.

Today, there's very few choices when it comes to building your communities online. Increasingly, we‚Äôre seeing people build communities on tools like Slack (and other IRC-alikes‚Ää; ‚ÄäGitter, Discord, etc.), rolling a self-hosted forum, or starting a Facebook group.

I‚Äôve been running large communities on these platforms for years, and have personally felt the pain of managing conversations with hundreds and thousands of people who contribute from all around the world. Even when everything is as carefully organized as can be things start to break down as these groups grow:

- With five conversations going on at the same time you‚Äôre not quite sure anymore who‚Äôs talking with whom and it‚Äôs impossible to keep track of it.
- You want to talk about this one topic somebody mentioned five hours ago but the message is now 15 pages up and nobody knows what you‚Äôre talking about anymore. Don‚Äôt even get me started on topics from days or even, gasp, weeks ago!
- This is amplified by the fact that searching and linking to old messages is often a pain. Many times valuable and interesting conversations are lost forever, or the knowledge is trapped in the tool itself, never to be discovered from the outside.

### The Spark

I'm not on my own building Spectrum, on my side I have my two good friends [Brian](https://twitter.com/brian_lovin){:target="_blank"} and [Bryn](https://twitter.com/uberbryn){:target="_blank"}.

During the past two years they have run a podcast network called SpecFM and hosted a Slack community for all of their listeners. As the community grew (the Slack team had 9,000 members!), they realized that Slack just wasn‚Äôt the right place for it to live‚Ää‚Äîconversations were getting lost, people were talking over one another, and it was a constant game of whack-a-mole with notifications.

After investigating all the other products and options, they realized that nothing quite fit their needs for having productive and engaging conversations with so many people from all around the world. So they set out to build a new space for the SpecFM community. Spectrum was born.

### The Flame

As Brian and Bryn build their first MVP of the new SpecFM platform, other people started describing their own painful experiences of growing communities on tools like Slack or Facebook.

That‚Äôs when they reached out to me, and together we realized that this could be so much bigger than a one-off side project. We have the chance to build a platform to equip any group or business with the right tools to manage and grow their online community.

Based on our own experiences, and those of all the groups we‚Äôve worked with and talked to, we approached the problem heads-on and built Spectrum differently, tailor-made for the purpose:

- Every conversation on Spectrum starts as a thread. A thread can be anything from a short question to a rich text post with images, code snippets, embeds, and more. Every post has a conversation attached to it where people can discuss.
- Conversations in threads are modeled after real-time chat applications. It feels more present than a static list of threaded comments, and when multiple people are online talking at the same time it feels like any other chat app you know.
- Because Spectrum is a platform, you are able to join all of your favorite communities with one profile, one login, one set of notifications and direct messages‚Ää.
- By having all of your communities in one place, you get a single feed of all the things that you're interested in, sorted by where the most active conversations are taking place right now.

## It exists!

We‚Äôve been building Spectrum for the past five months, first as a public alpha for friends and family and then as a public beta with the SpecFM community as our test bed. It‚Äôs been five exciting months and I‚Äôm proud of how far we‚Äôve come in this short amount of time.

Already, there are vibrant and active communities around a variety of (currently mostly tech-y) topics like [React](https://spectrum.chat/react){:target="_blank"} (1,100+ people), [styled-components](https://spectrum.chat/styled-components){:target="_blank"} (700+ people), [Figma](https://spectrum.chat/figma){:target="_blank"}, [crypto currencies](https://spectrum.chat/crypto){:target="_blank"} and many more!

A great example of a thread on Spectrum is [this discussion about what exactly makes a ‚Äúcomponent‚Äù](https://spectrum.chat/thread/d350b632-a12b-4490-97f8-603384142e01)‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe conversation lives at a shareable link, indexed on search engines for people to discover, contribute and share. The thread is not locked up in a real-time feed of chat; instead, people can join the conversation at any time in the future and chime in with new thoughts, all without losing the original context.

Check out the [explore page](https://spectrum.chat/explore){:target="_blank"}, find some topics that interest you and come chat; if the community you're looking for doesn't exist [create a new one](https://spectrum.chat/new/community){:target="_blank"}, we'd love to have you!

## We're hiring

We have so many things to do and so many ideas we want to try and we can't and don't want to do it alone. We're looking for **a fullstack JavaScript developer with deep Node.js knowledge** and **an experienced React Native developer who isn't afraid to touch some backend code** to join our small team and play a critical role in the creation of this new platform.

No matter who you are, or where you‚Äôre from, we want to work with you if you care about online communities. You should be ready to play a key part in building the best tools to make managing and growing healthy communities easier and better than ever before. We‚Äôre a young product, which means that you will have significant impact on our product roadmap. You will have an opportunity to help us structure our core infrastructure from the very beginning to be scalable, performant, and accessible for every community we serve. You will learn a lot with us every single day, making sure we're building the right thing at the right time the right way.

We‚Äôre fully remote so it truly doesn‚Äôt matter where in the world you are. (Brian and Bryn are in San Francisco, I‚Äôm in Vienna) Our technical stack is a Node.js GraphQL server backed by RethinkDB and a React plus Apollo Client frontend. We‚Äôre looking for folks that are happy to jump into all parts of the stack with a bias towards shipping. (knowledge of GraphQL or RethinkDB is a plus, but not required)

If that sounds like you, please get in touch ([hey@spectrum.chat](mailto:hey@spectrum.chat))‚Äî‚Ääwe‚Äôre excited to hear from you!

## Thank you Thinkmill

On a last, more personal note I have to thank Thinkmill. Being employed to work on OSS was an amazing experience and I'm ever grateful to [Jed](https://twitter.com/JedWatson){:target="_blank"}, [Boris](https://twitter.com/BorisBozic){:target="_blank"} and the whole Thinkmill crew for the opportunity to do so for a year. I learned a lot and had so much fun doing it!

Onwards and upwards. Talk to you on Spectrum! üöÄ
